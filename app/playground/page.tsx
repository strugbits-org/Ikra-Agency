/**
 * The CMS copy is fetched on the server and the page is cached rather than rendered per

 * inside it talked to a third party.
 *
 * A literal, and it has to be: Next reads route segment config statically, so
 * `WIX_REVALIDATE_SECONDS` — which is the same minute, and is what `wixQuery` asks for on its
 * own fetch — cannot be imported into this position. Change both or neither, and `lib/wix` is
 * where the minute's reasoning lives.
 *
 * **This is the ceiling, not the period**: the shortest revalidate among a segment's fetches
 * governs, so the figure the build reports is whichever of this, the query's and the token
 * exchange's is lowest.
