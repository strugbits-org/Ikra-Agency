/**
 * The site's one cursor: a blob that inverts the *brightness* of whatever it passes over,
 * so it is legible on every section without being told what colour that section is. It
 * trails the pointer on an ease, stretches along its direction of travel, and wobbles when
 * the reader stops.
 *
 * **It replaces the hero's white dot rather than joining it** — see `RESTORE THE HERO DOT`
 * in components/HeroNarrative.tsx for the seven-step uncommenting that brings that back.
 *
 * Five things here are load-bearing.
 *
 * **The inversion is `backdrop-filter: grayscale(1) invert(1)`, and NOT a white element on
 * `mix-blend-mode: difference`.** They look like the same idea and they are not, because
 * this brand's palette is warm. `difference` renders `255 − backdrop` per channel, and the
 * inverse of a colour with a lot of red and almost no blue is a colour with a lot of blue —
 * so a white blob came out cyan on precisely the two surfaces it crosses most:
 *
 *     bg-accent  #fa5e3c  ->  #05a1c3   the wave, the approach rail, every dot
 *     text-ink   #390303  ->  #c6fcfc   the founders' headings, the approach copy
 *
 * That was reported, and no choice of blob colour fixes it — any light element differenced
 * against a warm ground lands in the cyans. Taking the greyscale *first* throws the hue away
 * before the inversion can act on it, so the blob is only ever white, grey or black.
 * Measured off the running page, against a flat swatch of each, every one at a channel
 * spread of exactly 0:
 *
 *     bg-black  #000000 -> #ffffff    bg-cream  #fef5f3 -> #080808
 *     bg-gray   #dfdfdf -> #202020    footer    #484848 -> #b7b7b7
 *     text-ink  #390303 -> #f1f1f1    navy      #0e3159 -> #d3d3d3
 *     bg-accent #fa5e3c -> #828282
 *
 * **`bg-accent` is the surface to look at first if this is ever retuned.** Its greyscale
 * value is 125 of 255, i.e. almost exactly mid, so the inversion hands back 130 — a blob
 * and a ground at practically the same *luminance*. It reads clearly all the same, because
 * a neutral grey against a fully saturated orange separates on chroma rather than on
 * brightness, and that is the whole of its margin there. A future ground that is both
 * mid-luminance and desaturated would have no margin at all and would need something else.
 *
 * It is also why the background below is `transparent` rather than a colour: an opaque fill
 * would hide the filtered backdrop entirely, which is the whole effect.
 *
 * **It portals to `document.body`.** `position: fixed` does not work inside
 * `#smooth-content`: ScrollSmoother's transform on that element makes it the containing
 * block for fixed descendants, so anything fixed in there scrolls with the page. Same
 * reason and same fix as components/ScrollBar.tsx and the hero's own cursor.
 *
 * **The native cursor is hidden from JS, not from CSS**, through `html.blob-cursor` (the
 * rule is in app/globals.css beside `html.scroll-locked`, which is the same pattern). A
 * static rule would hide the pointer for a reader who never gets a blob — reduced motion,
 * a touch device, or JavaScript that failed — and a page with no cursor at all is worse
 * than a page with the ordinary one. The class goes up on the first mouse movement and
 * comes down the moment a finger touches the screen.
 *
 * **The stretch is computed from the blob's own velocity, not the pointer's**, and that is
 * the one deliberate departure from the sketch this was built from. The pointer's velocity
 * falls to zero on the single frame the mouse stops, while the blob is still several frames
 * behind and visibly travelling — so a pointer-derived stretch snapped the blob round in
 * mid-flight every time the reader came to a halt. Its own velocity eases in and out by
 * construction, because it is the eased position's own derivative, and at a steady speed
 * the two are identical anyway. It also removes the need for a second smoothing constant.
 *
 * **One rAF loop, not two.** The sketch ran the idle wobble on a loop of its own alongside
 * the main one, and both wrote `border-radius` on every frame — so which shape you saw was
 * decided by the order the two happened to be queued in. The wobble is a branch inside the
 * one loop here, chosen off the time since the last movement.
