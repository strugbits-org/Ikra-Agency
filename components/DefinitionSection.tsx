/**
 * The stage's and the frame's clip, with the **top edge left open**.
 *
 * Both used to be `overflow-hidden`, and that clipped the one thing that has to
 * escape them. The statement arrives by being lifted up to `STATEMENT_LIFT_VH` of a
 * viewport above its resting place (see the entrance in ./definition/timeline) —
 * deliberately, because it has to be on screen while this section's top edge is still
 * below the fold — but it sits only ~5vh under the frame's own top edge. So for the
 * whole of its entrance it was *above its own clipping container*: entirely invisible
 * across the stretch where the hero washes to gray, which is what made that read as an
 * empty gray screen, then emerging with 92% of it cut off, which is the clipping.
 *
 * Only the top is opened. The other three edges are the load-bearing ones: the bottom
 * hides the definition parked a full frame below (exactly where the footer begins) and
 * gives the camera its one-viewport window, and the sides clip the growing circle.
 *
 * Nothing is exposed by opening it. Above the frame's top edge is the stage's, and
 * above the stage's is the hero — which by this point is washed to the identical
 * `--color-gray`, with this stage at z-50 painting over it. Once either is pinned
 * their top edge *is* the viewport's, so there is nothing above them to draw into.
 *
 * 100vh of headroom against a 40vh lift: enough for the paragraph's own height on top
 * of the lift, at any viewport, with room to spare.

/**
 * The editorial statement, with the round photo and the "ikra." wordmark stacked
 * below it, the wordmark layered over the photo — and then the wordmark's own dots
 * carrying the page into the footer.
 *
 * Assembled from five parts:
 *
 *   ./definition/timeline   every beat, in vh of real scrolling, and the phase map
 *   ./definition/sequence   the pin, the two edge triggers, and the tail's clock
 *   ./definition/measure    the layout figures every frame is computed against
 *   ./definition/dots       the wordmark's dots and their solved ballistics
 *   ./definition/*.tsx      the layers themselves, driven purely through refs
 *
 * The refs and the effects stay here, so each effect's dependencies are visible next
 * to the state they read; the bodies are plain functions in those modules.
 *
 * The stage is the camera: exactly one viewport, pinned, clipping a track that is
 * two screens tall. Pinned with GSAP rather than CSS `sticky`, which does not work
 * under ScrollSmoother's transform-based fake scroll (see the note in
 * HeroNarrative).
 *
 * Reduced motion registers no ScrollTrigger and renders a static end state: no veil,
 * no pin, no falling dots, and the definition in normal flow below the composition.
 * The section's `height` goes to `auto` with it, since there is no pin left to
 * reserve scroll distance for.

              Three rows — 1fr, auto, 1fr — with the statement first and the
              composition second. The two 1fr rows take equal shares of what the
              middle leaves, which puts the circle on the frame's own centre line
              instead of in the middle of the space *below* the statement.

              A grid rather than absolute positioning because it degrades in the
              right direction: a 1fr row cannot shrink below its content, so on a
              viewport too short for both, the third row gives up its share and
              the composition slides *down*, never up into the copy.

              The clip is load-bearing now that the footer is the next screen down:
              the definition is parked a full frame-height below the top, which is
              exactly where the footer begins. It leaves the top edge open so the

              Hidden below `md` as a quick fix — the tail's cue that fires the wordmark's
              dissolve and the dots' fall reads DictionaryPanel's measured height, which
              is `display:none` (so reads 0) at this width same as it is on tablet; with
              nothing to measure the cue falls back to a fixed scroll distance that knows
              nothing about where this in-flow block actually sits, so the fall could fire
              while this text was still on screen. Hiding it sidesteps that rather than
              fixing the cue itself — see the conversation this was flagged in if that
              needs revisiting properly instead.
