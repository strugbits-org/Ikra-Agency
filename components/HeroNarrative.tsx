/**
 * One continuous pinned sequence, assembled from four parts:
 *
 *   ./hero/timeline   every beat, in vh of real scrolling, and the phase map
 *   ./hero/sequence   the one ScrollTrigger that plays it
 *   ./hero/intro      the load timeline, which runs before any of it
 *   ./hero/HeroLayers the layers themselves, driven purely through refs
 *
 * The refs and the effects stay here, so each effect's dependencies are visible
 * next to the state they read; the bodies are plain functions in those modules.
 *
 * Layering (back to front): the background still with the footage over it, the wavy
 * band, the doors, the hero copy, the gray wash, then the header. The band sits
 * *under* the doors deliberately — both are the same orange, but it means a ribbon
 * caught mid-close is swallowed by the returning panels rather than floating over
 * them. The wash sits over the copy and under the header for the same kind of
 * reason: everything it covers is already gone by the time it arrives, and the one
 * thing that isn't is the wordmark.
 *
 * Reduced motion registers no ScrollTrigger and renders a static end state: doors
 * parked open over the footage, copy as a plain column, ribbon drawn in full.
