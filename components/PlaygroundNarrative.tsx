/**
 * The playground's first section, assembled on the same five-part plan as the three
 * marketing sections:
 *
 *   ./playground/timeline   every beat, in vh of real scrolling
 *   ./playground/sequence   the one ScrollTrigger that plays it
 *   ./playground/river      the ribbon's geometry, solved from the stage's measured size
 *   ./playground/metrics    every measured layout figure
 *   ./playground/*Layers    the layers themselves, driven purely through refs
 *
 * The refs and the effects stay here so each effect's dependencies sit next to the state it
 * reads; the bodies are plain functions in those modules.
 *
 * Layering, back to front: the footage, the river, the scrim (only where the river is the
 * narrow one), the copy, then the header. The copy is deliberately *over* the river rather
 * than beside it — in the reference its first lines cross the ribbon's upper bend and are
 * painted on top of it.
 *
 * Reduced motion registers no ScrollTrigger and renders the static end state: one viewport
 * tall, the copy already at rest, the river drawn but not drifting.
