/**
 * The case studies, as typed data — the one file to edit for content.
 *
 * Deliberately the whole of the section's copy and imagery: the track is one cell per
 * project plus the heading and the closing panel, and the pin's length is that track's
 * measured overflow (see ./sequence), so adding or removing an entry retimes the section and
 * needs no other change. Nothing else in ./cases knows how many there are.
 *
 * ## The schema is the reference's caption, and nothing more
 *
 * Frame analysis of the reference shows a caption of exactly three parts under each image —
 * a title, a two-line description, and a right-aligned link. There is no category line, no
 * tag row and no per-project accent colour; earlier versions of this file carried all three
 * and they were inventions. They are gone rather than hidden.
 *
 * ## One study is real; the rest are placeholder, and knowingly so
 *
 * The first entry is Café Technica, and it is the only one with a `link` — it points at
 * `app/work/cafe-technica`, which is a full page built from the client's own material. The
 * two below it are still stand-ins.
 *
 * `public/` holds no case-study photography — every image in it is caviar or coastal stock,
 * and most is already in use: `hero-bg.jpg` is the hero's backdrop, `section2-vertical.mp4`
 * its clip window, the three `caviar *.jpg` files the footer's merging row, and
 * `caviar-falling-video.mp4` the definition's window. These four are the most visually
 * distinct of what is left.
 *
 * The copy is placeholder for a stronger reason than the images: naming clients this studio
 * may not have would be a claim rather than a layout. The *shape* is the reference's, so
 * replacing the words cannot disturb the composition.
