/**
 * The pinned horizontal track.
 *
 * ## Why the pin is GSAP's, and why nothing here is `sticky`
 *
 * `app/layout.tsx` wraps the page in ScrollSmoother, which fakes scrolling with a transform
 * on `#smooth-content`. Under a transformed ancestor `position: sticky` never engages and
 * `position: fixed` scrolls with the page, so the only thing that can hold this stage still
 * is ScrollTrigger's own `pin`.
 *
 * Unlike the hero and the definition section this uses `pin: true` with GSAP's own pin
 * *spacing* rather than `pinSpacing: false` against a hand-written section height. Both are
 * correct; this one belongs here because the pin's length is not a hand-written figure at
 * all — it is the track's measured overflow over TRAVEL_PER_SCROLL, so letting ScrollTrigger
 * reserve exactly that keeps one source of truth in `end` instead of splitting it between a
 * trigger and a stylesheet.
 *
 * ## Two clocks, and they cannot be collapsed
 *
 * The pin drives the traverse. A second, smaller trigger drives the section's vertical
 * approach, and it has to exist separately because it runs *before* the pin does — the pin
 * does not start until this section's top edge reaches the viewport top, and the approach
 * happens while that edge is still crossing the screen.
 *
 * They are not two clocks over one moment, which is this repo's most expensive recurring
 * bug. They are two *positions* feeding one paint: the rise reads the lesser of the two
 * approaches, so whichever is behind is in charge and neither can drift against the other.
 * There is one paint function, and every value it writes is a pure function of the pair —
 * paint the same pair twice and you get the same frame.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately absent
 *
 * No inner-image parallax, no card scale, no scrim, no per-line stagger, no exit animation.
 * Each was measured *out* of the reference rather than left out — see the head of ./timeline
 * for the frame evidence. The traverse plus one rise per cell is the whole section.
