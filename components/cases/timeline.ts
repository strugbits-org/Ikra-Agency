 * Every number the case studies' choreography uses. No DOM, no GSAP instances — the paint

 *
 * ## Everything here was measured off the reference recording, not chosen
 *
 * The section is a pinned horizontal track: vertical scrolling translates a row of
 * equal-width cells leftwards across a held viewport. The figures below come from frame
 * analysis of the reference capture (1920×1040, ~1905px layout viewport once its scrollbar
 * is taken off), so they are transcriptions rather than taste:
 *
 *   cell pitch          952.4px  → 50.00vw  (11 independent divider-pair measurements)
 *   image width         801px    → 42.05vw  → 50vw − 2 × 4vw
 *   image aspect        801:552  → 1.451
 *   travel              1px of scroll per 1px of track, i.e. `scrollWidth − innerWidth`
 *
 * The one figure that is now a preference rather than a transcription is the last of
 * those: TRAVEL_PER_SCROLL below deliberately runs the track faster than the reference
 * did. It is the only knob for the section's pace.
 *
 * ## The only per-cell animation is the rise, and that is the whole of it
 *
 * Frame analysis ruled out everything else the previous build had. Tracking the reference's
 * artwork *within* each card frame — the tower in the first card, its "Hi, I'm Alex."
 * lettering — put it at 15.8–16.0% of the frame's width at both ends of the traverse, so
 * there is **no inner parallax**. The card frames measured 792–795px across the whole
 * traverse, so there is **no scale**. Cards leaving on the left held their caption's
 * baseline to the pixel until they were clipped, so there is **no exit fade, drift or dim**.
 *
 * What is left is a single vertical entrance per cell, and it is not a stagger of that
 * cell's lines — the caption's underline rule and the frame's top edge moved by identical
 * amounts at identical times (24px at the same frame, repeatedly), so the cell's whole
 * content block translates as one piece.
