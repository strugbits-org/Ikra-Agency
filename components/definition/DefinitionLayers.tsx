            lines and nothing else about it was wrong — so pinning it there makes
            every viewport from `lg` up read the same way.

            crosses the centre line when it starts at the frame's own 176px
            gutter, so from `lg` the paragraph alone steps out into that gutter.
            It is deliberately not a change to the frame's padding — `measure`
            reads `paddingLeft` to place the wordmark's slide, so moving the frame
            would move the logo's resting position with it. */}

/**
 * The round window and the "ikra." wordmark, stacked in one grid cell.

 * balance it on the frame's centre line.
 *
 * Grid stacking: both children sit in the same cell, so the wordmark layers over the
 * photo with no absolute positioning and no translate-centring for GSAP to overwrite
 * later.
 *
 * Both are sized against vw *and* vh, capped in px, with a px floor. The vw term
 * makes them big on a wide screen; the vh term stops them growing into the statement
 * on a short one, which is what keeps the no-overlap guarantee honest; the floor
 * stops the vw term collapsing them below 100px on a phone.
 *
 * The last term of each is the crowding cap, and it is why they carry a fourth term at
 * all — see MARK_WIDTH. `38vw - 262px` is exactly `58vw - 400px` scaled by 19/29, so
 * the disc gives way by the same proportion the wordmark does and the 1.5× below holds
 * *through* the squeeze. Without it the wordmark would shrink onto the disc around
 * 1180px and the overhang either side would drop from ~24% of the circle to ~13%.
 *
 * The wordmark stays a consistent 1.5× the circle at every breakpoint, because the
 * overhang either side of the disc is the composition rather than a coincidence. The
 * resting size is genuinely free to change: `baseSize` is read from the computed
 * style and `maxScale` is solved from it, so a smaller disc simply scales further to
 * reach the same full-bleed frame at the same sharpness.
