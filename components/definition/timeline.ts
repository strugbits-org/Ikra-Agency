/**
 * The definition section's timeline, in vh of actual scrolling through the pin —
 * same convention as the hero's, and for the same reason: the pin runs `top top` →
 * `bottom bottom`, so progress 0→1 covers `height − 100vh`, not the whole height.
 *
 * Written as a chain of derivations rather than a list of numbers, so retiming any
 * beat carries the rest along instead of quietly opening a gap or an overlap.
 *
 * Everything here is scrubbed except the tail, which is a *cue*: crossing TAIL_AT
 * starts a move that plays to completion on its own clock. See TAIL_AT for why that
 * one stretch cannot be scroll-driven.
 *
 * Phases, in vh of actual scrolling through the pin (see PIN_VH). Once the
 * statement is gone the window and the definition run concurrently, so the phases
 * are listed by what they belong to rather than strictly by start time:
 *
 *   (before)  the statement is already resolving as this section arrives. Its
 *             reveal is cued off the hero's wash to gray — the same instant, ~10vh
 *             before that section's pin releases — so the gray arriving and the
 *             text arriving are one movement, and the first line is legible on the
 *             frame it clears the bottom edge rather than after a wait on an empty
 *             screen. See STATEMENT_LIFT_VH. It finishes 55vh before the
 *             pin, which is the settled beat this next phase then interrupts.
 *     0–50vh  the statement slides up and out of frame, fading as it goes.
 *   20–120vh  the round window opens until it fills the screen. The photo behind
 *             it neither moves nor scales — it is a full-bleed viewport-cover
 *             layer, counter-scaled each frame against the window's own scale
 *             (see placePhoto), so the window uncovers more of a sharp photo
 *             instead of magnifying a small one. Coverage is exact rather than
 *             eyeballed: the window scales to the farthest viewport corner from
 *             its own centre.
 *   70–120vh  the photo dissolves, starting at the growth's midpoint. That is
 *             deliberately *before* coverage, so a fifth to a third of the screen
 *             is still gray and the photo reads as a circle blooming and
 *             dissolving rather than a full-bleed frame that arrives and sits.
 *   measured  the wordmark slides left into the final composition, clearing the
 *             right half for the definition. The only phase with no vh window of
 *             its own, and it must stay that way: it is driven off the definition's
 *             *position*, spread over the last MARK_APPROACH_FRAC of that block's
 *             run at it and finishing as it arrives. At the current fraction of 1
 *             that is the whole approach, so it opens with the climb at 50vh and
 *             lands at 73.5–75.4vh on a desktop, 81.7 at 1024×1366 — later on a
 *             tall viewport, which is why the landing is not a constant. Eased at
 *             both ends (MARK_SLIDE_EASE); see MARK_APPROACH_FRAC for why the span
 *             is at its ceiling and for the two vh-window versions that failed.
 *   50–220vh  the definition travels up the right-hand side, from below the fold
 *             to clear off the top. No fade — a pure move, and the window still
 *             being longer than the distance is what keeps it from rushing —
 *             but only by 20% now rather than 70% (DICT_VH). Shortening it costs
 *             the settled side-by-side composition first, since the wordmark's
 *             cue cannot fire until the definition has climbed most of the way
 *             up; 28–51vh of that beat is left, by viewport.
 *  173–195vh  the wordmark alone — what is left of the hold that used to sit
 *             here, now a consequence of the two windows rather than a phase.
 *  195–245vh  the wordmark dissolves where it stands, starting at 85% of the
 *             climb above so the two overlap (LOGO_FADE_FRAC) rather than queue —
 *             the letterforms are going while the last of the definition is still
 *             leaving. Its three dots are separate solid elements standing on the
 *             artwork's own, so the letterforms thin out from under them and the
 *             dots are left hanging in mid-air.
 *      245vh  the tail is cued — the dots let go here, and this is as early as
 *             that can be: it is the end of the dissolve, because the dots have
 *             to outlast the wordmark rather than leave while it is still there.
 *             Everything past this point comes off the
 *             scrub. Crossing the mark starts a timed gesture that runs to
 *             completion whether or not the scrolling continues, and rewinds if
 *             it is crossed back. See TAIL_AT for why this one stretch cannot be
 *             scroll-driven: every earlier phase holds a pose when the scroll
 *             stops, and a thrown ball does not.
 *      0–0.9s the camera pans down the track onto the footer. Nothing there
 *             moves under its own power: it is already sitting in the layout,
 *             and this is the page arriving at it.
 *   ~0.5–2.8s its contents resolve from transparent — all of it as one, over
 *             exactly the span the dots are in the air, so the falls and the
 *             footer are one gesture with one ending. No stagger, deliberately:
 *             staggering guarantees frames where part of the footer has resolved
 *             and part has not. Most of it plays after the camera has stopped,
 *             which is the point — a fade that fits inside the pan is spent
 *             while the footer is still rising.
 *   ~0.7–2.8s the dots fall — all three released together, on a moment solved
 *             per viewport (see `measure`) so the beat before it is only as long
 *             as the camera needs. Not an interpolation with a bounce ease on
 *             it: the vertical is a solved ballistic trajectory — thrown up as
 *             it lets go, accelerating down, three decaying parabolic bounces,
 *             then still. Each dot's flight lasts its own share of DROP_SECONDS
 *             so all three obey one gravity, and they are given different lift,
 *             restitution and sideways drift so no two paths are the same. Both
 *             endpoints are fixed points on screen with the camera in neither,
 *             so the dots hang in the viewport and fall through it while the
 *             page pans behind them.
 *  245–269vh  the last of the scroll, and all the gesture gets (TAIL_VH). It drives
 *             none of it. Deliberately shorter than the ~2.8s it takes, because
 *             this is the end of the page: the reader reaches the bottom and the
 *             dots land there, rather than landing early and leaving a screen of
 *             finished footer to scroll through. See TAIL_VH for why losing the pin
 *             mid-flight costs nothing while this section is last.

/**
 * The statement's *entrance* — the rise and fade it arrives on.
 *
 * The move itself is unchanged: 32px of rise and an opacity, out of a CSS
 * `ease-out`, which is exactly what RevealBlock does everywhere else on the page.
 * What changed is the clock under it.
 *
 * It used to be RevealBlock: an IntersectionObserver waiting for 35% of the
 * paragraph to be on screen, then a fixed 1s CSS transition. Both halves of that
 * are wrong for a block that arrives on a hand-off. The threshold cannot be met
 * until the statement is already climbing the screen, so it is preceded by a
 * stretch of blank gray with nothing in it; and the transition then runs on
 * wall-clock time, so the paragraph resolves whether or not the reader is still
 * scrolling and cannot be scrubbed back. It reads as an event that happened near
 * the text rather than as the text arriving.
 *
 * It was scrubbed for a while, across the hand-off from the hero's wash to this
 * section's top edge reaching 55%. That fixed the threshold half of the problem but
 * kept the other one in a new form: the paragraph resolved at the reader's scroll
 * rate, so stopping anywhere in the window left it posed at 40% — visible, half
 * faded, plainly waiting for more input. On a gray screen with nothing else on it,
 * that is the one place a half-finished pose has nowhere to hide.
 *
 * So it is a *travel* now rather than a reveal, and scrubbed rather than cued. It was a
 * cue for a while, matching the hero's own hand-off moves, and that was wrong for one
 * reason: a cue resolves the paragraph wherever it happens to be, and where it happens
 * to be is ~20vh below its section's top edge — which itself only clears the bottom of
 * the screen as the hero unpins. So it faded in perfectly, below the fold, and the
 * reader had to scroll again to reach it. It has to stay level with an edge that is
 * moving, which is a job for scroll position and not for a clock.
 *
 * That mark sits *behind* the viewport's bottom edge, halfway through the hero's gray
 * tail, and being behind it is the whole point. It used to be 98 — the section's top
 * edge just clearing the bottom, the first frame the paragraph could be seen in —
 * which put it strictly *after* the veil had finished dissolving the hero's wordmark
 * out. Three things that belong to one hand-off then needed three separate scrolls:
 * gray arrives, scroll, logo fades, scroll, text begins.
 *
 * It is the tail's *full* length now — the earliest this can be placed at all, since
 * before it the hero is still pinned and this section is not merely below the fold but
 * behind a fixed, opaque stage. So the veil's fade and this reveal start on the same
 * frame, and the paragraph is most of the way up by the time its first line clears the
 * bottom edge: whatever of the section can be seen has text in it.
 *
 * Which is the honest limit of what timing can do here. The stretch of bare gray that
 * is left is not this cue waiting — it is the section physically rising into view, and
 * no cue can put a paragraph on screen while a fixed full-viewport stage is over it.
 * Removing it means overlapping this section up into the hero's tail and sliding the
 * pinned stage with it, which re-bases every offset measured in this file.
 *
 * The move itself is unchanged from the RevealBlock it began as: 32px of rise and an
 * opacity out of an `ease-out`. Only its clock has changed, twice.

 *
 * Longer than the distance it covers, which is the property that matters rather
 * than the number: the block travels H + its own height, so a *longer* window
 * means it crosses slower than the page scrolls and holds visible in the middle
 * instead of being carried off with the layout. That travel is about 147vh on a
 * 16:9 desktop and about 171vh on a short viewport or a phone, where the block is
 * taller relative to the screen.
 *
 * It came down from 250 because the climb was costing two and a half viewports of
 * scrolling to move one block out of the way. At 170 the rate is 0.86× page speed
 * on a 16:9 desktop, 0.82× on a tall one — and about 1.0× on the short cases,
 * which is the one thing worth knowing before changing it again: there the window
 * has met the travel, so the block now keeps pace with the layout instead of
 * lagging it, and the "holds visible in the middle" property is spent. It reads
 * fine — a block moving with the page still crosses the screen over a viewport of
 * scrolling — but going below about 150 would put it genuinely *faster* than the
 * page there, which stops reading as a climb and starts reading as being flung
 * off. That is the floor.
 *
 * Most of what the old length used to buy is recovered elsewhere rather than

 * leaving to the dots letting go is 145vh rather than 280.
 *

 * measured against this window — see MARK_APPROACH_FRAC. The settled side-by-side beat
 * runs 25–47vh at this length depending on the viewport, against 60–75 before,

 * The wordmark's slide out of the centre and over to the left. It has no cue of its
 * own — the move is a response to the definition arriving alongside it, so its timing
 * is computed per frame from where the two actually are (see the phase in ./sequence).
 *
 * **It has no window in vh, and it must not be given one.** The move is a response to
 * the definition coming up at it, so it is driven off the *gap between the two* rather
 * than off the clock — see the phase in ./sequence. That is the whole of what these two
 * constants say, and both are shaped so no arithmetic can put the slide before the
 * thing it is responding to.
 *
 * Two vh-window versions came before it and each failed at one end. The first started
 * the slide MARK_LEAD_VH (15vh) before the two came level and ran it for MARK_VH
 * (50vh), so it *finished* 35vh after the definition had arrived — the wordmark was
 * still 70% out in the middle of the frame with the body text painted over it, which
 * at 1024×1366 was 114px of shared band. Anchoring the same window to the far end
 * instead fixed the landing and broke the opening: the slide then began at ~48vh
 * against a definition that does not start climbing until 50, so the wordmark drifted
 * off centre with nothing on screen to explain it.
 *
 * Both are the same fault. A window in vh cannot know where the definition is, and
 * "when the wordmark should move" is a question about exactly that. The definition's
 * own progress can be read directly, so it is.
 *
 * MARK_APPROACH_FRAC is the share of the definition's run at the wordmark — from
 * clearing the bottom of the screen to touching it — that the slide is spread over.
 * Raise it and the wordmark reacts from further away; lower it and it leaves the move
 * later and quicker. Whatever it is set to, the slide still finishes exactly as the
 * definition arrives.
 *
 * **1 is the ceiling, and it is at it, because the rate at 0.5 was indefensible.** That
 * approach is a far smaller slice of the climb than it reads as: measured, touchP is
 * 0.261–0.282 across 1280–1920 desktops, because the definition starts a whole frame
 * below the fold and first touches the wordmark while it is still low on the screen. At
 * 0.5 the entire slide therefore had 11.8–12.7vh of scroll — roughly one wheel notch —
 * to carry 293px (1280) to 524px (1920) of travel, i.e. **3.1× to 3.8× the page's own
 * speed**. That is what made the wordmark read as flung aside rather than moved.
 *
 * At 1 it gets the whole approach, which halves it to 1.54–1.91× average, and
 * MARK_SLIDE_EASE takes the ends off at a 1.57× peak — so the worst instant of the new
 * curve (2.42× at 1280/1440/1600, 3.00× at 1920) is still below the *constant* rate of
 * the old one. Slower at every point, not merely on average. 1024×1366 is the easy case
 * either way and always was: a 240px-floored wordmark has only 216px to go and touchP is
 * 0.353 there, so it ran at 1.0× before and peaks at 0.78× now.
 *
 * Above 1 it *can* be raised into trouble, which is the one thing the old note here had
 * backwards: the span outruns the approach, `touchP − markSpan` goes negative, and
 * `markP` is already positive at `dictP` 0 — so the wordmark would be part-slid on the
 * frame the phase opens. At exactly 1 the slide starts on the frame the definition does,
 * never before.
 *
 * **So this knob is spent, and the next one is DICT_VH.** The span is `touchP · DICT_VH`
 * with touchP measured off the boxes, so the only way left to slow the slide is to
 * lengthen the climb — and that retimes LOGO_FADE_AT, TAIL_AT and PIN_VH with it, and
 * slows the definition itself from 0.86× page speed toward 0.6×. It is a section-wide
 * decision rather than a tweak to this move, which is why it is not made here. Wide
 * viewports are what would want it: the travel grows with the width while the span is
 * near-constant in vh, so 1920 stays the worst case at any fraction.
 *
 * MARK_CLEAR_PX is the gap the definition's top edge keeps from the wordmark's bottom
 * edge on the frame the slide completes. In px rather than vh because it is a gap
 * between two boxes, not a beat. Note it works against the span: a larger clearance is
 * an earlier touch, so it shortens the slide as well as raising it.

 * The wordmark dissolves in place — letterforms only. The three dots are
 * separate solid elements sitting exactly on top of the artwork's own, so what
 * the eye sees is the "ikra." melting away and leaving its dots behind, hanging
 * in mid-air. Nothing is masked or cut out; the dots simply outlast the thing
 * they came from.
 *
 * This is where the dots begin — the dissolve is what puts them there — so where
 * it is cued is where the whole footer gesture is cued. It is now a fraction of
 * the definition's climb rather than a mark after it, which used to be
 * `DICT_AT + DICT_VH + 30`: the definition had to be entirely gone, and then a
 * further 30vh of hold had to pass, before anything else would move. Reading it
 * off the climb instead ties the two together — the letterforms start going as
 * the definition is on its way out, and the beat between them is a chosen
 * overlap rather than a leftover gap.
 *
 * Below 1, so the dissolve starts while the definition is still on its way out
 * rather than after it: at 0.85 the block still has its last 15% of climb to make,
 * which puts it above the frame's top edge with only a band of its own tail still
 * showing. It was 0.95, and the letterforms now start going about 17vh earlier.
 *
 * There is a hard floor under this, and it is a paint-order one rather than a
 * matter of taste. The dots are children of the stage, so they paint above the
 * frame's entire contents including the definition, and `lit` turns them on at
 * exactly this mark — set it while the definition is still crossing the wordmark
 * and they would show through the text. That crossing finishes between 71% and
 * 77% of the climb depending on the viewport (latest on a short one, where the
 * block is tallest relative to the screen), so **0.78 is the floor** and 0.85
 * leaves about 13vh of margin at the worst viewport.
 *
 * There is a second, softer margin behind it: paintDots does not ramp a dot's
 * opacity up from this mark but from 20% into the dissolve, so for the first
 * fifth of it the dots are switched on and still fully transparent. Going under
 * the floor would therefore not show anything immediately — which is exactly why
 * the floor is written down here rather than left to be discovered.
 *
 * LOGO_FADE_VH is the dissolve's own length, and it is what gates the dots
 * *leaving*: TAIL_AT sits at the end of it, so the fall cannot be cued any earlier
 * than the letterforms are gone. That ordering is not negotiable — the whole read
 * is that the dots outlast the thing they came from, and a dot that detaches from
 * a wordmark still visible underneath it is just a dot sliding off a logo.
 *
 * So bringing the fall earlier means making the dissolve quicker, not overlapping
 * it, and 92 came down to 50 for that reason. It was close to a full viewport of
 * scrolling to fade one element out — three or four seconds at a reading pace,
 * most of it spent below 10% opacity where there is nothing left to watch. At 50
 * it is under two seconds and the fall is cued 42vh sooner. The two ratios
 * paintDots reads off this (the 20% lead and the 80% span of the dots' own
 * crossfade) are fractions, so they follow it down and the crossfade stays in
 * proportion.

 * The tail — the camera onto the footer, and the dots' fall — is the one thing
 * here that is NOT scrubbed. Crossing TAIL_AT fires a timed timeline that runs
 * to completion on its own clock, exactly like HeroNarrative's ribbon and its
 * orange→gray wash, and for exactly the same reason: there is no stopping place
 * that can leave it half done.
 *
 * That is not a preference, it is what the content demands. Everything before
 * this point holds a *pose* when the scroll stops — a half-risen statement, a
 * part-open window, a half-faded wordmark all read as compositions. A thrown
 * ball does not. Frozen between two bounces it stops being a ball with weight
 * and becomes an orange circle parked in mid-air, and no amount of retiming
 * fixes that, because a scrubbed animation freezes by definition.
 *
 * The camera is inside the same timeline rather than left on the scrub, because
 * the fall must not begin until the footer has stopped moving (see below). Two
 * clocks would mean that ordering could be broken by how fast someone happened
 * to be scrolling; on one clock it holds by construction.
 *
 * Relative timings are carried over unchanged — the pan is the same fraction of
 * the gesture it used to be of the scroll, and so is every fall — so this is the
 * same animation on a different clock, not a new one.

 *
 * 24, down from 180 by way of 80 — and small enough that it is no longer really a
 * guard. That is deliberate, because as a guard it could never have worked: the
 * gesture is on a clock and this is scroll, so a reader who crosses TAIL_AT and stops
 * gets the animation for free and still has every remaining vh of this to grind
 * through on a finished footer. At 180 that was up to ~170vh of nothing, at the very
 * end of the page. The buffer only ever helped the reader who kept moving, and
 * punished the one who stopped to watch.
 *
 * Being outrun is close to harmless *here specifically*, which is what makes the guard
 * dispensable. The pin ends at `bottom bottom`, and since this section is last in the
 * document that instant is also the end of the scroll: the unpinned stage sits exactly
 * where the pinned one did, so there is no jump and nothing beneath is uncovered, and
 * the tail plays out in full view on its own clock — `tailTween` paints through
 * `renderTail`, not through the ScrollTrigger, so losing the pin does not stop it.
 * The reader simply arrives at the bottom of the page and watches the dots land.
 *
 * `scrub: 1` helps rather than hurts at this length: it lags the cue by up to a
 * second, so the gesture tends to fire right as the scroll runs out, which is where it
 * wants to be seen.
 *
 * All of that is load-bearing and conditional — it holds while nothing follows this
 * section. `Footer` is currently commented out in app/page.tsx; if it comes back, the
 * stage will scroll away and uncover it mid-flight, and this has to go back up toward
 * a rate no gesture can beat (~180).

 * with the dots' fall, and mixing clocks over a shared moment is the single most
 * expensive mistake in this codebase — the hero's orange→gray wash, its door close and
 * this section's own wordmark slide were all the same bug. Two clocks over one moment
 * drift apart by exactly the reader's speed, so which of the two appears to lead is
 * decided by the wheel. On the tail's own clock the merge is frame-locked to the fall
 * at every speed and in both directions, and a cue cannot skip or compress frames the
 * way a scrub does when it is crossed quickly — so the speed-independence the brief
 * actually wanted is stronger here than a scrub could give.
 *
 * IMAGE_IN is when the three resolve, as a fraction of the camera's pan. They come up
 * *with* the camera and finish before it stops, which buys the beat this whole
 * arrangement depends on: a moment where they are unmistakably three separate
 * photographs, before anything converges. Without it the merge is over before the eye
 * has established there was ever more than one image.
 *
 * The merge itself runs over exactly the dots' flight — release to last touchdown — so
 * the photograph locks up on the frame the last dot settles. One gesture with one
 * ending, rather than two things that happen to finish near each other.
 *
 * **The merge closes the gaps; it does not stack.** All three survive, none scales, and
 * none passes over another: each keeps its width and height for the whole gesture and
 * only slides horizontally until its edges meet its neighbours'. The end state is one
 * continuous wide photograph made of three adjacent panels, so the travel per panel is
 * exactly the grid's own gap — solved from the measured boxes in ./measure rather than
