// ── RESTORE THE WAVE — step 1 of 5 ── uncomment the import below.
//
// The wave is off. Bringing it back is five edits, every one of them tagged
// "RESTORE THE WAVE" — grep for it — and they have to be done together:
//
//   1. this import;
//   2. the <WavyBand> element further down this file;
//   3. in ./timeline.ts, delete the fourth GAP_LINES entry — "holding your business
//      back" is the ribbon's own copy and joined the gap copy only because the ribbon
//      went away, so with the wave back it would otherwise be said twice;
//   4. in ./timeline.ts, LEAP_AT and LEAP_IN_VH back to their wave-driven form, so the
//      closing line waits for the ribbon to clear the seat again instead of arriving on
//      the copy's cadence;
//   5. in ./sequence.ts, `bandVis` / `bandClear` and the BAND_CLEAR_AT import, which
//      are the gate that keeps the line and the wave out of that shared seat.
//
// import WavyBand from "./WavyBand";

// How many ems wide the closing line is, so its size can be solved from the span
// between the wedges rather than picked — widen the wedges and the line shrinks to
// suit.
//
// Not a guess: summing the advance widths in
// public/fonts/ZalandoSansSemiExpanded-VariableFont_wght.ttf gives 4.494em for
// "until you " and 7.009em for "make the leap", so 11.50em at weight 400. The bold
// run renders at 700 and the font ships HVAR, so its advances are wider than that —
// 14 leaves room for the bold run being up to ~12% wider *and* still clears the span
// at every width from 768px up. Keep it above ~12.4 if the wording changes.
const LEAP_EMS = 14;

/**
 * The same measurement for the two-line rendering, where the governing run is "make
 * the leap" alone — 7.009em at weight 400, so ~7.85em at the 700 this renders at, and
 * 9.5 carries the same ~1.22× headroom over that as LEAP_EMS does over 11.50.
 *
 * A phone needs the second line and cannot be talked out of it. The one-line solve
 * wants a 364px span to hold 14em at the 26px floor, which on a 390px screen leaves
 * 13px for both wedges — so no aperture that keeps a visible wedge can fit this
 * sentence on one line, and the old floor simply overflowed it across the orange in
 * `text-accent`, where half the words are the panels' own colour and vanish. Breaking
 * it is the only lever that does not either shrink the line under legibility or delete
 * the wedges the ribbon is pinned to.
 *
 * The ceiling is 44 rather than LEAP_EMS's 82 because two lines are twice as tall: the
 * solve reaches the ceiling by ~640px of stage, and 44px × 1.3 × 2 is already 114px of
 * copy standing where the ribbon was.

// the size was solved for rather than wherever the box happened to run out.
//
// Deliberately carries NO font-size of its own. It used to say `text-3xl
// md:text-[60px]`, which silently overrode the size the container solves and pinned
// the line to a flat 60px — 741px wide, against a span that is 609px at 1440, so the
// ends sat on top of the wedges on every laptop. `text-accent` words over
// accent-coloured orange simply disappear, which is why the overlap has to be

          rather than all on one side — it is not a licence to overhang.

          On the ribbon's centre line, since it takes over that space once the
          ribbon clears — and sized to the span between the wedges (see LEAP_EMS)

          Below that the sentence breaks in two and is solved against its longer

          on a phone; the one-line floor used to overflow onto them, and half the
