 * The gap copy's size, solved from the span it has to sit in rather than declared.
 * The aperture is a fraction of the viewport and a declared size is not, so any
 * fixed size is only right at one width: a flat `md:text-[60px]` is 647px of line
 * against a 605px gap at 1440 and a 430px gap at 1024, putting the ends on the
 * orange at every laptop size there is.
 *
 * The ceiling is that same 60px and the floor is the old mobile size, so the widest
 * screens and phones are both unchanged. Between them — roughly 700px to 1200px —
 * the floor binds and the line still overhangs, because the gap is too narrow for
 * this many words at a readable size. LEAP_EMS's clamp makes the same concession.
 *
 * Solved from the *lead* line alone, not the longest of the three: it is the one
 * locked to the aperture, so its fit is what is read frame by frame. Sizing to
 * "between who you've become" instead would put the whole statement at ~35px on a
 * 1440 screen. The other two still cross onto the wedges, but by far less, since
 * they shrink along with it.
