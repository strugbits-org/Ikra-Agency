/**
 * The panel's box: oversized top and bottom so the diagonal drift never slides it off
 * its own short edge, and DOOR_PANEL_BLEED_PX wider than its share so the two overlap
 * rather than merely meet when the doors seal. Both come from ./doors, because the
 * ribbon's anchors are measured against the same overhang.
 *
 * A function of the geometry rather than a constant, because the panels are *wider*
 * below DOOR_NARROW_MAX_W — that is what lets them travel further and still seal (see
 * doorsForAperture). The width and the travel have to come from the same geometry or
 * the wedge they leave is the wrong size.
 *
 * Below DOOR_NARROW_MAX_W (`doors.narrow`) this is a horizontal bar spanning the full
 * width instead — see the doc on DoorPanels for why the axis swaps there and not the
 * numbers. Nothing here needs the diagonal-drift overhang in that orientation: the
 * panel only ever travels along the axis it is oversized on (see paintStage), so
 * there is no perpendicular drift for a short edge to expose. `doors.panelW` is still
 * the right fraction to read — it is `doorsForAperture`'s solved share of the
 * travel axis, not tied to which axis that is — reused here as a share of *height*
 * rather than of width, with the same DOOR_PANEL_BLEED_PX seam guard applied to
 * whichever dimension is now doing the overlapping.

/**
 * The orange doors. Oversized so the closed state fully overlaps and the diagonal
 * drift never exposes a panel's short edge. In reduced motion they render already
 * parked — the same offsets in vw/vh, since there is no ScrollTrigger to drive them.
 *
 * Below DOOR_NARROW_MAX_W the two panels are horizontal bars sliding open top/bottom
 * instead of the desktop's diagonal left/right wedges — a mobile-only request: the
 * closing line ("until you make the leap") shares GAP_LINES' own font size (see
 * ./GapCopy), and at that size the phrase is wider than even the narrow *aperture*'s
 * gap could ever give it, on one line or stacked onto two — so no amount of
 * measuring where to break the line could keep "make the leap" off the wedges. A
 * top/bottom split leaves the full stage width open instead, which is what the text
 * actually needs; it is not available on the left/right axis at any aperture this
 * section's wedges could plausibly leave.
 *
 * The refs and the DOM elements are the same two used on desktop — only *how* they
 * are boxed, anchored and translated changes, both here and in ./sequence's
 * `paintStage`, both keyed on the same `doors.narrow` `doorsFor` already computes.
 * Nothing above DOOR_NARROW_MAX_W reads a different branch than it did before.
