/**
 * The load sequence: plays once on mount and is not scroll-driven. The hole opens
 * up over the footage, then the headline fades in.
 *
 * Sets `introDone` when it lands, which is what gates the scroll phases —
 * ScrollTrigger fires an onUpdate at creation, and without the gate it would snap
 * the clip straight to its resting size and cut this short.
 *
 * Then calls `catchUp`, and that call is not optional. Flipping the latch alone leaves
 * the sequence waiting for a scroll event to notice, and none is owed: the scrub's
 * tween settles about a second after the reader's last input and this timeline can
 * outlast it comfortably. Anyone who scrolled during the entrance and stopped would be
 * left looking at a frozen stage until they moved again. One edge-triggered call hands
 * the stage over at the true scroll position instead.
 *
 * And it publishes `hurry`, which the sequence calls the moment the reader scrolls past
 * the opening's first mark. That is the other half of handing over cleanly, and it
 * became necessary when the opening stopped being cued. The stage is frozen here until
 * this lands, so the scroll runs on underneath it — and where a cued opening would then
 * play its move from the beginning whatever the position, a scrubbed one is *read* from
 * the position, so the hand-off painted the doors wherever the reader had already got
 * to. They snapped from shut to half open at a reading pace, and to fully open past it,
 * taking the gap copy's first line with them. Hurrying the entrance keeps the hand-off
 * down at the top of the section where there is nothing to skip. It is not a
 * cancellation: a reader who has started scrolling has said they are done looking at
 * the fade, and the fade still finishes, at 6×.
 *
 * Returns the caller's cleanup, or nothing under reduced motion, where the whole
 * job is three `gsap.set`s and there is no timeline to revert.
