     * the doors jump to wherever the scroll says, instead of playing the designed
     * swing — is a fixed vh/s (`OPEN_VH / OPEN_SECONDS`, similarly for the close). That
     * threshold was set once, tuned against how fast `vh` actually moved under
     * ScrollSmoother's own `smooth: 1.2` easing sitting in front of this trigger's own
     * `scrub: 1`. Below `md` there is no smoother (see SmoothScrollProvider) — a real
     * touch swipe, and especially the momentum that continues after the finger lifts,
     * hands `vh` a raw delta with only one damping stage behind it instead of two, so
     * it moves through the door's span faster for the same gesture. The threshold did
     * not change; how much of an ordinary mobile scroll now clears it did — which is
     * why the swing that used to be visible on ordinary paces reads as an instant
     * open/shut on a phone.
     *
     * This restores the missing stage, scoped to exactly the two reads that are
     * speed-sensitive. It deliberately leaves `opening.aim`/`close.aim` and every
     * other phase (`trackDirection`, the gap copy, the ribbon) on raw `vh` — those
     * only ever compare it to a fixed mark, so smoothing it would just add latency
     * with nothing to buy back. Only a value being read as a *rate* needs damping.
     *
     * A plain exponential toward `vh`, not a hard cap: a cap would leave the doors
     * permanently behind the reader's true position after a long, fast scroll, with
     * nothing to reconcile the two once they stop. An exponential decays back onto
     * the raw value on its own once the reader holds still, at the same rate it fell
     * behind — so a slow reader is never behind by more than a few frames, and a fast
     * one gets exactly the "clock leads, then the scroll finishes the job" behaviour
     * the desktop crossover already describes, just at a speed a phone can produce
     * more easily than a mouse wheel could.
     *
     * DOOR_SMOOTH_TAU is a starting figure rather than a measured one — there is no
     * way to record a reference swipe's real momentum profile the way the rest of
     * this file's constants were measured, and neither a devtools emulator nor
     * synthetic touch input reproduces a phone's native fling physics closely enough
     * to tune it against. If the doors still snap open on a real device, raise it; if

      // the aperture was still scaling it up, and the two behind it flashing through.
      // Now that the doors rest at a fixed mark (see the note on scrubbing in

      // back through the gap they are closing.
      //
      // The exit is the close's own progress rescaled to reach 1 at the seal — no
      // STACK_OUT, and no window of its own in vh. Both halves of that matter: an

      // pace — 32vh of `sine.inOut` is slowest exactly at the start, so half a second in
      // the line has barely moved. At 90vh/s those 32vh take 0.36s, so the line was
      // fully seated while the wave was still closing through the same seat. Reading the
      // wave directly instead makes the hand-over hold at every speed, in both
