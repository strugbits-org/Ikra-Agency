/**
 * The hero's timeline, in vh of actual scrolling through the pin.
 *
 * Written as a chain of derivations rather than a list of numbers, so retiming
 * any beat carries the rest along instead of quietly opening a gap or an overlap.
 *
 * The copy is scrubbed; four beats are *cues* — the opening, the ribbon, the doors'
 * close and the orange→gray wash. Crossing a cue starts a move that plays to completion
 * on its own clock, so it costs no designed scroll distance, cannot be left
 * half-finished by stopping, and runs at the same speed however fast the wheel was
 * turned. Marked "(cue)" below.
 *
 * The trouble with a cue, and the thing this file has been rewritten around three times,
 * is that it costs an *unknown* amount of real scroll — the reader keeps moving while it
 * plays — so it lands at a mark that depends on their speed, and anything measured from
 * that landing inherits it. An unbounded landing at the front of the section is what
 * made the gap copy come apart on a fast scroll.
 *
 * The three cues in the tail are safe because nothing is keyed to a mark behind them.
 * The opening is safe for a different reason, and it is the one idea worth carrying out
 * of here: it has a **scroll floor** under it. The move may run ahead of the scroll and
 * never behind it, so the landing is bounded by DOOR_OPEN_AT even though its timing is
 * not — one scroll of any size plays the whole thing on the clock, and the copy below
 * still starts from a fixed number. See OPEN_VH.
 *
 * The rule for anything added here: a cue at the front needs a floor, or the beats
 * behind it need to not exist.
 *
 * Phases (see PIN_VH):
 *      1vh     (cue) the whole opening, and the whole of the first scroll however
 *              small it is: 1.5s of one continuous eased path with no resting place
 *              anywhere inside it. The panels travel across all of it, though the
 *              first 41% is invisible because they are still overlapped; the hole
 *              the footage is seen through closes across exactly that stretch, so
 *              the footage hands straight over from the shrinking hole to the
 *              widening gap with no bare orange between them (SEAL_OVERSHOOT). The
 *              footage never moves or resizes, and the headline fades on the hole's
 *              driver so it is gone at the instant the hole shuts. Then the doors
 *              carry on opening diagonally and stop partway across the screen,
 *              leaving wedges in the bottom-left and top-right corners for good.
 *              "growth creates a gap" is not played *over* this — it *is* this,
 *              growing out of the centre point the panels part from with its width
 *              locked to the gap's in constant proportion (see leadSeat), so it
 *              reaches full size on the frame the panels stop.
 *   ≤75vh      where that lands, which depends on how far the reader travelled
 *              during the 1.5s: ~17vh at a reading pace, 75 at a flick. 75 is the
 *              ceiling and not a preference — past it the scroll floor has taken
 *              over and the doors are open regardless (see OPEN_VH). Everything
 *              below is written against the ceiling, so none of it moves.
 *   75–87vh    the line holds at full size, doors at rest, nothing else moving —
 *              longer than 12vh for anyone whose doors landed early (LEAD_HOLD_VH).
 *   87–117vh   it climbs away, shrinking and blurring out — an ordinary exit.
 *  102–147vh   "between who you've become" rises into the seat as the lead line
 *              leaves it; the overlap is what makes an exchange one gesture rather
 *              than a swap. 45vh of arrival — about one scroll gesture (COPY_IN_VH).
 *  147–155vh   it holds.
 *  155–185vh   it climbs away.
 *  170–215vh   "how the world sees you" rises in behind it, on the same overlap.
 *  215–223vh   it holds.
 *  223–253vh   it climbs away.
 *  238–283vh   "holding your business back" rises in behind *it*, on the same
 *              overlap again. It was the ribbon's marqueeing copy until the wave was
 *              commented out — see RESTORE THE WAVE in ./BandLayer.
 *  283–291vh   it holds.
 *  291–321vh   it climbs away, clearing the stage — and from 0.7 of the way through
 *              that exit the wave would be coming in under it (BAND_DRAW_AT).
 *  312–372vh   (cue, both ends) where the wavy ribbon drew in right-to-left (a clip,
 *              not a fade), bridging the two wedges, then closed the same way round.
 *              The ribbon's markup is commented out, so nothing is drawn across this
 *              stretch now and nothing reads it either — the sweep runs invisibly and
 *              reaches only itself (see RESTORE THE WAVE in ./BandLayer).
 *  306–351vh   "until you make the leap" rises into the seat, on the copy's own
 *              cadence and with the copy's own arrival: it starts as the line above it
 *              is halfway out, exactly like the three hand-overs before it, so the
 *              wedges are never bare between them (see LEAP_AT).
 *  351–389vh   it holds.
 *     389vh    (cue) the doors close over 1.15s, retracing their opening exactly, and
 *              the third scroll is the whole of it. The line recedes on the same
 *              progress, scaling to nothing at full opacity and never fading,
 *              reaching zero exactly as the panels meet — 72% of the way through the
 *              close, since closing retraces the opening (see CLOSE_SEALED_P). The
 *              remaining 28% is the identical flat orange rectangle every frame.
 *              the scroll floor under that close, so it is complete at a fixed mark
 *              however fast the reader goes (CLOSE_VH). Not the close's length —
 *              below the crossover it plays at its own speed inside this.
 *              (cue) the moment the panels meet, the sealed orange washes over to
 *              the next section's gray, off the close's progress rather than a mark
 *              of its own so nothing can open a flat-orange stall between the two.
 *  414–434vh   the last 20vh of the pin, and all that is left of it. The wash
 *              is playing, DefinitionSection's veil is fading in over it to the
 *              same gray, and its statement is resolving below the fold — all
 *              three cued off this one instant (see HERO_GRAY_TAIL_VH). The pin
 *              then releases and that section's top edge, statement first, comes
 *              up from the bottom of the screen while the gray is still arriving.
 *              There is no flat-gray hold left between the two.

/**
 * Why the opening is scrubbed, and what that costs.
 *
 * It was cued for two versions: crossing 8vh fired one 1.6s move that sealed the hole
 * and cracked the doors, and a second mark fired a 0.9s swing. That is a better *door* —
 * one gesture, one speed, never parked half open — and it is what broke everything
 * behind it, for a reason worth stating plainly.
 *
 * A cue costs no *designed* scroll but consumes real scroll, because the reader keeps
 * moving while it plays. So the doors came to rest wherever 2.5 seconds of scrolling
 * happened to reach: 52vh at a reading pace, 119vh at an ordinary one, 327vh on a fast
 * scroll — out of a 342vh section. Everything after the doors is measured from where
 * they stop, so the gap copy had 290vh of room, or 223, or 15. It was compressed to fit
 * (1.3× / 2.7× / 3.3×), and past the cap on that compression it had to *start before the
 * doors stopped* — which is the visible fault: the lead line's exit ramp running while
 * the aperture was still scaling it up, and the two lines behind it flashing past. Three
 * different sequences out of one section, decided by the wheel.
 *
 * Scrubbing the legs fixed all of that — the doors rested at DOOR_OPEN_AT at every
 * speed, so the copy played at 1.00× whether the reader crawled or flicked — and it
 * could not deliver the beat this section is actually built on. A scrubbed span is a
 * *distance*; how long it takes is the reader's business. So it was tried at 20vh, which
 * was a quarter of a second and jerky, and at 34vh, which looked right at 0.7s and was
 * three vh longer than a wheel notch could carry — one scroll sealed the video, barely
 * moved the doors, and left a blank orange screen. There is no length that does both: no
 * span a door can visibly swing across fits inside 11vh.
 *
 * So the opening is timed again, and the floor is what makes that safe this time. The
 * clock gives "one scroll opens it" for a gesture of any size; the floor caps the
 * landing at DOOR_OPEN_AT so the copy below still starts from a fixed number, which is
 * the whole of what the cued versions got wrong. Both properties, and the only thing
 * paid for them is that DOOR_OPEN_AT is a *ceiling* rather than a rest position, so
 * LEAD_HOLD_VH carries the slack for readers whose doors landed early.
 */

/**
 * How long the whole opening takes when the reader is not outrunning it, and how that

 *
 * A pure distance cannot do this job, which is what the two attempts before this one

 * and jerky, and the second — long enough to look right at 0.7s — left a wheel notch
 * short of finishing it, so one scroll sealed the video and barely moved the doors and
 * the reader was looking at a blank orange screen. There is no length that fixes both:
 * a notch is ~11vh, and no span a door can visibly swing across fits inside one.
 *
 * So it is timed. Crossing SEAL_AT starts a move that plays to completion on its own
 * clock, which is what makes "one scroll opens it" true for a gesture of *any* size,
 * a single notch included. SEAL_FRAC splits the path: 0.42s of the video closing, then
 * 1.08s of the doors, back to back with nothing between them.

/**
 * How long the closing hole outlives the opening aperture, as a fraction of the path.
 *
 * The two legs used to be sequential — hole shut, *then* panels move — and that left a
 * beat of blank orange in the middle of the opening that had nothing in it at all. The
 * cause is that the panels are wider than half the screen each, so they go on
 * overlapping for the first 41% of their travel (see DOOR_SEALED_AT) and the aperture
 * does not appear until then. Sequential legs therefore mean: hole gone at 28% of the
 * path, gap appears at 58%, and 0.44s of solid orange between them.
 *
 * So they overlap instead. The panels now travel across the whole path and the hole
 * closes across the fraction of it that ends where the aperture opens — which costs
 * nothing, because a panel sliding while still overlapped is invisible, and it is the
 * same footage on both sides of the hand-over. This is the small overlap on top of that,
 * so rounding can never put a bare frame between the hole's last pixel and the gap's
 * first: for a moment the shrinking hole sits over the widening gap, both showing the
 * footage, and the eye reads one continuous opening.
 *
 * The seal's end is *solved* from DOOR_SEALED_AT and the leg's ease rather than written
 * down (see APERTURE_AT in ./sequence), so retuning either cannot silently reopen the
 * gap this closes.

 * sat through twice. That reasoning does not hold here, because coming back up this beat
 * has not been watched — it has been watched *forwards*. Backwards it is a different
 * thing to look at: the doors swing shut and the footage grows back out of the seam, and

 *
 * At 1.5× the whole return played in 1.0s, and the visible part of it is shorter still —

 * in paintStage then took over and dragged the rest through at the reader's speed, and
 * what arrived was the video simply *there*, on orange, with no closing and no growth.
 * 0.8 makes the return 1.9s, which is slower than the opening and deliberately so: it

 * The scroll floor under that move, and the reason a clock is affordable here at all.
 *
 * A cue costs no *designed* scroll but consumes real scroll, because the reader keeps
 * moving while it plays — so it lands wherever their speed happens to carry them, and
 * everything measured from that landing inherits their speed. That is what put the gap
 * copy at 1.3× / 2.7× / 3.3× and, past the cap on it, started the copy before the doors
 * had stopped. The whole fault was the *unbounded* landing.
 *
 * So the move is allowed to run ahead of the scroll and never behind it:
 *
 *     pathP = max(cued, ramp(vh, OPEN_SPAN))
 *
 * Below about 35vh/s the clock is ahead and the reader gets the full 1.5s, one gesture,
 * however small. Above it the floor takes over and the opening finishes in whatever
 * scroll is left of this span — quicker, but still one continuous eased move, and
 * bounded. Either way the doors are open by DOOR_OPEN_AT, so that is a fixed mark again
 * and every beat below it is a fixed number, exactly as when the whole opening was
 * scrubbed. Nothing downstream can be compressed, reordered or skipped.
 *
 * 74vh, up from 52, because 52 put the crossover at ~35vh/s — an ordinary firm scroll —
 * and past it the floor drags the doors through the rest of their travel at the reader's
 * speed, which is the "sometimes it snaps open" case. The same number bounds the reverse,
 * so it fixes the mirrored complaint on the way back up at the same time. It is where the
 * two costs cross. Longer, and the clock governs for faster readers
 * but LEAD_HOLD_VH has to carry more slack for the reader who opens the doors in one
 * notch at 11vh and then has to reach the copy. Shorter, and the floor binds at

 * is still two things in the same place. Shut until the ribbon is 55% cleared, fully

 * stopping place can leave the stage with a gap frozen half shut. It was scrubbed
 * across 125vh once, on the reasoning that the close is the section handing itself
 * back rather than a beat of its own — but that is five or six notches to shut a door
 * the reader has already finished with, and the shut doors are the gate to the next
 * section, so grinding them closed holds up everything behind them.
 *
 * The *opening* is scrubbed and this is not, which looks like an inconsistency and is
 * the rule stated at the top of this file: a cue lands at a mark that moves with scroll
 * speed, which is ruinous where a sequence is measured from it and free at the end of
 * the section, where the only thing downstream is a wash riding this tween's own

 * close is floored against, so the move is complete at a fixed mark whether the clock
 * or the reader got it there; a flick that outruns it is caught by the next section's
 * veil, which is opaque before the boundary crossing either way.
 *
 * Both numbers are floors rather than preferences, and the tail below is where any
 * shortening has to come from instead. Splitting the close over two cues and trimming
 * these to buy back scroll was tried and reverted: the second gesture arrives while
 * the first is still playing, so the panels never visibly finish — the reader sees
 * them jump the last of the way as the stage turns gray. A close that cannot be

 * This was 4, on the reasoning that a cue "plays out as the boundary crosses rather
 * than being cut off". That reasoning had a hole in it, and the hole is the veil:
 * DefinitionSection's cover is fully opaque one vh before the pin releases, so
 * anything still moving at that point does not play out as the boundary crosses, it
 * plays out *underneath* an opaque gray slab. With 4vh of window against a 1.15s move
 * the close was about a seventh done when the veil arrived at any ordinary pace, and
 * a reader had to be under 4.3vh/s to watch the doors actually meet. The gesture was
 * effectively never seen.
 *
 * A cue alone cannot fix that, because a cue costs no designed scroll and so cannot
 * hold the pin. A scrub alone cannot either — a wheel notch is ~11vh and no span the
 * panels can visibly travel across fits inside one. So the close gets what the opening
 * has: a clock with a scroll floor under it, which plays the whole designed move for
 * anyone below the crossover and compresses it continuously above, but is *complete*
 * at a fixed mark either way.
 *
 * 25 rather than the ~57 that matching the opening's crossover would give, and the

 * spends after a move that has already finished on its clock — stop just past
 * DOOR_CLOSE_AT and the doors are shut and the stage is gray with the whole span still
 * ahead. It also pushes the next section that much further below the fold at the
 * moment the wash lands, and the statement's lift has to clear the sum of the two (see
 * STATEMENT_LIFT_VH). Short is better on both counts.
 *
 * What it costs is only the crossover: at 25 the clock leads below ~22vh/s and the
 * scroll finishes the job above it. Being outrun is not a failure here — the floor
 * guarantees the panels are shut by CLOSE_END either way, which is the property that
 * matters and the one a bare cue could not give.
