/**
 * The travelling copy — the one thing on this screen that moves.
 *
 * Anchored at `top-0` with no vertical centring of its own, exactly like
 * `definition/Dictionary`'s panel and for the same reason: the sequence drives `y` here, and
 * a `gsap.set` rebuilds the whole transform, so a Tailwind `-translate-y-1/2` or a flex
 * `items-center` would be wiped the instant the first frame ran. Where "centred" actually is
 * is measured (see ./sequence's `restY`), which also makes it a number the travel can be
 * derived from rather than a second constant.
 *
 * Where it sits follows the river's own shape rather than a breakpoint, for the reason
 * PlaygroundScrim gives: against a wide river it takes the right-hand half at its measured
 * edges, clear of the water except at its own top-left corner, which is the reference's own
 * composition; against a narrow one — which sweeps the whole width — it goes full width over
 * the river and the scrim, capped at COPY_NARROW_MEASURE so a tablet does not set 90
 * characters to the line.
 *
 * `centred` is the reduced-motion path, and it is a class rather than a measurement because
 * in that mode nothing ever writes a transform here — so the CSS centring that GSAP would
 * otherwise wipe is safe, and is the one construction that needs no measurement at all.
 *
 * It also starts hidden in every other mode, exactly like the hero's headline and clip box
 * and for the same reason: the effect that places it cannot run until after the first paint —
 * one commit to flip `mounted`, another for the effect itself — so a block left visible here
 * is painted at the *top* of the stage, where it never belongs, for about a second. The
 * sequence's first frame is what lights it, on the same call that puts it below the fold.
