 * what it measured, and a `clamp()` written out as a Tailwind bracket string at its call site
 * buries exactly that. This is also why sizes arrive as inline styles rather than classes.
 *
 * The reference is one viewport — 1904 × 913, the browser area above the taskbar in
 * `hero-playground.mp4` — so a fixed-px transcription would only be right at that width.
 * `fluid(min, ref, max)` restates a measured pixel figure as its own share of 1904, floored
 * and capped: at the reference width every value is exactly what was measured, and away from
 * it the page scales rather than breaking.
 *
 * Type sizes were solved rather than eyeballed, the same method `study/metrics.ts` uses —
 * measure a line's ink width and divide by the exact advance-width sum of its string taken
 * from the TTF. Three independent lines of body copy return 23.96, 23.88 and 24.15, so 24px;
 * the cap height of its "A" (17px against the font's 0.714 cap) agrees at 23.8.
