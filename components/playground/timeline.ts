/**
 * The playground section's timeline, in vh of actual scrolling through the pin — the same
 * convention as `hero/timeline.ts` and `definition/timeline.ts`. The pin runs
 * `top top → bottom bottom`, so progress 0→1 covers `height − 100vh`, which is why
 * `sectionVh` is `pinVh` + 100 and why multiplying progress by the *section* height would
 * overstate real scroll.
 *
 * Three beats, and the first of them is read straight off the reference recording rather than
 * designed:
 *
 *   0–85vh     the copy climbs from below the fold toward the centre of the screen, stopping
 *              CLIMB_TRAVEL_FRAC of the way there, and the header leaves over the last
 *              stretch of that. Nothing else moves: the river is measured stationary in the
 *              viewport across the whole reference clip.
 *   85–115vh   the assembled composition holds, still, so that it exists as a state the
 *              reader arrives at rather than as a single frame in passing — see HOLD_VH.
 *   115vh      the pin releases and the section scrolls away as an ordinary adjacent block,
 *              uncovering what follows. Verified as plain flow: through the release the
 *              stage's bottom edge and the next section's top edge are the same number on
 *              every frame, so nothing overlaps and nothing is covered.
 *
 * The release being an ordinary scroll rather than another phase is the recording's own
 * behaviour, and it is checkable in it: once the copy parks, the section's bottom edge and
 * the copy's rule move together at a fixed 222px offset for the rest of the clip — i.e. one
 * rigid layer leaving, not a second animation. (The clip itself never scrolls past this
 * section — the river fills all 78 frames of it — so it says nothing about the hand-off, and
 * the figures above are this build's, not transcriptions.)

/**
 * **How far the copy actually climbs, as a share of the whole distance from the fold to
 * centred.** 1 is the original: the block ends centred, the reference's own composition.
 *
 * This is the section's one shape knob, and it exists because the full climb read as too long
 * a haul — the block now stops short of centre and the section hands off to an ordinary
 * scroll rather than carrying it the rest of the way.
 *
 * **0.81 is measured off a supplied screenshot of where the copy should come to rest**, not
 * chosen: in an 882px viewport the block is 411px (46.6vh) and its top edge rests 40.5% down,
 * leaving 12.9vh of room under it — a travel of 59.5vh against a full 73.3vh. A first pass at
 * 0.25 was tried and rejected on sight, and the reason is the floor this value sits above:
 * the block is only *wholly* visible from about 0.64 up, and at 0.25 two-thirds of the
 * paragraph hung below the fold. Anything under ~0.64 cuts the copy off, which is what the
 * assertion at the foot of this file checks against the real measured block rather than
 * against that estimate.
 *
 * The headroom is worth knowing before retuning: at 0.81 the block stays fully visible up to
 * a block height of ~68vh, so ordinary reflow is covered and only an extreme short-wide
 * window would trip the assertion.

 * to centred — which is ~74vh at the reference's own viewport, so over this span the block
 * crosses at about 0.7× the page's own rate. That is the figure that matters: a block that

/**
 * How long the assembled composition holds before the pin releases — i.e. how much scroll sits
 * between the copy arriving at the centre and the section starting to leave.
 *
 * **It cannot be zero, and that it was is what made the section read as being taken over by the
 * one below it.** With `HOLD_VH = 0` the climb and the pin end on the same scroll offset, so the
 * copy's arrival and the section's departure are the same instant *by construction*: there is no
 * scroll position at which the finished composition exists. Measured through one continuous flick
 * at 1440x900, the last frame before the release had the copy at 314 against a resting 289 and
 * the next frame had the whole stage 81px up and climbing — the reader sees the copy rise, and
 * then sees it swept off the top with the gray coming up behind it, which is not a section
 * scrolling out, it is a section being removed mid-gesture.
 *
 * So this is the beat the section is actually for, and it is sized from the reader rather than
 * chosen: at an ordinary reading scroll of ~800px/s, 30vh of a 900px window is 270px, i.e. about
 * a third of a second with the composition assembled and still. That is the shortest dwell that
 * registers as an arrival. Below about 15 it is back to a flicker; above about 45 the stillness
 * starts to read as the page having stopped responding.
 *
 * Two earlier passes cut this to 10 and then to 0 chasing exactly the complaint it causes when
 * absent, on the theory that the frozen stretch was the problem. It was not — see the note on
 * `scrub` in ./sequence, which is where the real fault was, and which had to be fixed first for
 * any value here to behave predictably. A hold under a lagged clock is spent on catch-up rather
 * than on the composition, which is why removing it twice changed nothing the reader could see.
 *
 * It remains the one knob for the hand-off to whatever follows: raising it delays that vh for vh.

/**
 * **The narrow layout climbs the whole way, to centred — the original composition.**
 *
 * Not an exception to the shortening above but the same rule reaching a different answer: the
 * cut exists so the block does not haul further than it needs to, and on a narrow screen the
 * copy is full width over the river and tall against the viewport, so a short climb leaves its
 * foot below the fold at exactly the width with least room to spare. At 1 the block is wholly
 * visible whenever it fits the viewport at all, which is the best any fraction can do — see
 * the assertion in ./sequence, which is what would otherwise fire here.
 *
 * It is keyed to `narrow` — the river's own aspect test — and not to a width of its own,
 * because that flag already decides that the copy goes full width and takes the scrim, and
 * `riverIsWide`'s docblock is explicit that a second test standing in for it disagrees on
 * every tablet held upright.

 * drifted at 0.18× the page's rate, which reads as barely moving. Scaling the span with the

/**
 * The header leaves with the copy, over this window of the climb. It does not sit still — the

 * descends.
 *
 * **What is measured is the position, and only the position.** Tracking the descriptor's top
 * edge against the copy's rule at 30fps: the lockup holds at y = 18 while the copy climbs from
 * 851 to 797, then clears the top while the copy moves a further 36px. Converting those two
 * rule positions to the copy's own progress puts the move at **0.75 → 0.80** of the climb. The
 * end here is 0.85 rather than 0.80 because 0.80 is where the lockup's *top* left the screen,
 * not where its last pixel did.
 *
 * **The speed it appears to move at is not measurable from the recording, and it is worth
 * being explicit about why.** The reference's header is *cued* — a fixed-duration tween, ~0.2s
 * in both directions, and coming back up it keeps arriving for a sixth of a second after the
 * copy has already parked. A cued move's velocity against a scrubbed one is just the reader's
 * scroll speed, so its apparent ratio to the copy is whatever that happened to be: the same
 * recording gives **2.1×** going down and **5.4×** coming up. There is no design figure there
 * to reproduce.
 *
 * So this is scrubbed off the same clock as the copy, which preserves the one thing that is a
 * design figure and makes the two a single coupled gesture that cannot drift. A second clock
 * over one shared moment is this repo's most expensive recurring bug — the hero's wash, its
 * door close, DefinitionSection's wordmark slide, each drifting by exactly the reader's speed.

 * so the reader sees continuous motion that speeds up slightly into the release, never a stop
 * followed by a jump.
