/**
 * The shape of a case study. Not its content — that is the client's, and it lives in Wix.
 *
 * Every word and every picture on `/work/<slug>` comes out of the `CaseStudyPages` collection
 * and the `CaseStudyDeliverables` collection beside it; `./cms.ts` is the one place that knows
 * those exist, and it hands whatever it finds to `<CaseStudyPage>` as the record below.
 * Everything in `components/study/` renders this type and has never heard of Wix.
 *
 * ## There is one page and the bands are a fixed sequence
 *
 * An earlier version of this file carried a `bands` array per study, because the three studies
 * genuinely were different pages: QCIF ran six bands in a different order, with a brand band
 * the other two didn't have. That has been deliberately unwound — the three are one template
 * now, in one order, and what varies between them is which parts have anything in them.
 *
 * So the order lives in `./CaseStudyPage` as a plain list and every optional band renders
 * exactly when the CMS row has content for it. That is why almost everything below is
 * optional: a row with a heading and no picture is a client midway through writing, and the
 * page shows what they have written rather than a blank frame or an error. The two things
 * that are *not* optional are the masthead and the testimonial, which are the two bands every
 * study has and the two that would leave the page looking broken if they vanished.
 *
 * ## The content is not duplicated here, on purpose
 *
 * The home page's cards keep an in-repo copy of themselves (`components/cases/projects.ts`)
 * because an empty case-studies section would take the site's only contact panel off the home
 * page. A case study has no such hostage: if the CMS is unreachable the route 404s, recovers
 * on its own within one revalidate window, and — because the pages are prerendered — an outage
 * after a build is invisible, since Next goes on serving the last good copy. Against that, a
 * second copy of eight thousand words of the client's prose would be a copy nobody updates,
 * and the first anyone would hear of the drift is a reader seeing last month's page. What is
 * kept here instead is `STUDY_SLUGS`, so the routes exist in the build manifest whatever the
 * CMS says that day.

/**

 * nothing to add here. This list only guarantees that these three are prerendered at build
 * time even if the CMS happens to be unreachable during it, which is what keeps the home
 * page's three links from pointing at routes the manifest has never heard of.

 * One piece of supplied media, which may be a picture or a clip.

 * The two are one type because every slot that takes one takes either, and the band around it
 * cares about neither: it draws a box of `aspect` and fills it. `sources` is what decides —
 * present means a `<video>` over those URLs with `src` as its poster frame, absent means an
 * `<Image>` at `src`.
 *
 * **`sources` is a list rather than a URL because Wix's transcodes are not guaranteed.** Wix
 * only renders a clip as far up as its source resolution, so `720p` exists for some uploads
 * and answers `403` for others — see `wixVideoSources`, which is where the list is built and
 * why it has two entries. A browser walks a `<source>` list until one loads, so the band needs
 * to know nothing about which sizes this particular clip has.
 *
 * `src` is optional on both paths: a video may have no poster frame, and a row may name no
 * picture at all, in which case the slot draws nothing rather than an empty frame.
