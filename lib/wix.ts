/**
 * The site's one Wix client: an anonymous visitor token, and the two reads built on it.
 *
 * **Why a visitor token and not a key.** `WIX_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` is not itself a bearer
 * credential — it only proves a request is coming from this site's headless app, and it is
 * already scoped to one site because it was created inside that site's own Headless Settings,
 * which is why no site ID or client secret appears anywhere here. It is traded for a
 * short-lived token carrying exactly the identity an anonymous visitor on the Wix site would
 * have. So everything this module can read is already public, and the collections it reads
 * have to be set to `read: ANYONE` in the CMS or the query comes back empty rather than
 * failing — see FOUNDERS_COLLECTION.
 *
 * **Raw REST rather than `@wix/sdk`**, which is in `package.json` and unused. The site's one
 * other Wix call — `app/api/waitlist/route.ts` — is two `fetch`es against the same two
 * endpoints, and a second style for one POST would cost more in unfamiliarity than the SDK
 * saves; the token exchange below is the only thing it would have done for us. If the SDK is
 * ever adopted, it should take that route with it rather than sit beside it.
 *
 * Nothing here is a secret, so there is no `server-only` guard: a headless client ID is
 * designed to be used from browsers. What keeps this on the server is that `process.env`
 * reads it and only server components import it, which is also what lets the token cache
 * below be module scope rather than per visitor.

 *
 * The textbook answer to that is on-demand revalidation — tag the fetch, and have Wix call a

 * costs **three automations per collection** (created, updated, deleted, each naming exactly one
 * collection): six to set up and keep in step today, three more for every collection added
 * later, and a shared secret to carry through every environment. That is a standing maintenance
 * cost, paid by whoever inherits this, to save fifty-nine seconds.
 *
 * So the poll is the update path and there is nothing to wire up. The cost is one Wix round trip
 * per minute **per page somebody actually asks for** — Next only refetches on a request that
 * finds the cache stale, so a quiet site makes none at all, and a busy one makes sixty an hour

 * `expires_in: 14400` reproduced it exactly, on every collection in that render.
